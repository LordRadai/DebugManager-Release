# DebugManager

**WARNING**

This is a WIP mod, with the aim to aid modmakers debug their creation, or just to have fun. 
This mod might ban, so use this on an alt account and offline.
This tool is not meant to be a cheating tool, all of its features will be disabled if you are connected to the game servers. Either go offline using modengine or using Cheat Engine.

**Installation**

If you don't have Mod Engine or any other dll based mods, then rename DebugManager.dll to dinput8.dll and drag and drop all the files in your Game directory (same level as DarkSoulsII.exe).

If you use another dll based mod, then you need to follow these steps:
1) Get LazyLoader by ChurchGuard https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/677
2) Move your old dll mod inside the dllMods folder, then do the same for DebugManager.dll. DLL names do not matter, they can be named however you wish.
3) Move the DebugManager folder inside the Game folder, same level as DarkSoulsII.exe

**Usage**

The overlay window is opened by pressing F10 on your keyboard.

Most settings can be customized in DebugManager/DebugManager.ini, including the open key.

Here's an overview of what the tool includes.

**Settings**

	1. Draw Reference Frame: Show world reference frame on the player when enabled.

	2. Detection Radius: The distance at which Grab Colliders will be shown.
